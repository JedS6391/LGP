# Change Log

## [v-3.1](https://github.com/JedS6391/LGP/tree/3.1) (2018-12-19)

**Changes:**

- Kotlin 1.3.11
- kotlinx-coroutines 1.0.1
- dokka 0.9.17
- Removes IntelliJ project files

**Acknowledgements:**

- [Ulrik GÃ¼nther](https://github.com/skalarproduktraum) -- updated Kotlin, kotlinx-coroutines, dokka, and tidied up IntelliJ files.

## [v-3.0](https://github.com/JedS6391/LGP/tree/3.0) (2018-11-04)

**Breaking changes:**

- Most of the core components in the system now require an extra type parameter: `TOutput`. This is used to determine what type of output the programs have, enabling programs with single and multiple outputs
- Addition of classes/helpers to aid in handling programs with different numbers of outputs

*The version has been bumped to 3.0 to reflect these breaking changes.*

**Enhancements/Additions:**

- New `ExclusiveOr` bitwise operation
- Allow operations to be serialised with a `toString` method for easier program translation
- New example problem `FullAdder` to demonstrate the use of multiple-output programs

**Bug fixes:**

- Fix an issue where the `Or` operation was incorrectly performing a logical and
- Address a logic error in the Island Migration implementation that could cause problems with certain configurations

**Acknowledgements:**

- [Hongyu Wang](https://github.com/HongyuJerryWang) -- contributions to the implementation of multiple program outputs, full adder example, new operations, and bug fixes.

## [v-2.0](https://github.com/JedS6391/LGP/tree/2.0) (2018-10-11)

**Breaking changes:**

- The `Trainers` object no longer exists
- Related to above, the `Trainer` implementations have moved from `lgp.core.evolution` to `lgp.core.evolution.training`
- A new package `lgp.core.program` has been created and quite a few classes from `lgp.core.evolution` were migrated

The version was bumped to 2.0 to reflect these potentially breaking changes.

**Enhancements:**

- Added the ability to train asynchronously using the built-in `Trainer` implementations
- Update to the Kotlin 1.3 release candidate to make use of the soon to be stable co-routine APIs
