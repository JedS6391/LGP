This document describes the design of the LGP system and how to use it to get started with LGP.

It is assumed that the reader has prior familiarity with LGP, or has read the section on :ref:`lgp-ref`.

It should be noted that the code examples provided in this documentation are not extensive and a good reference for example usages is the ``nz.co.jedsimson.lgp.examples`` package provided. These examples can be viewed in the `LGP-examples repository <https://github.com/JedS6391/LGP-examples>`_.

For a complete, low-level API reference, see the `dokka API documentation <https://lgp.jedsimson.co.nz/api/html/index.html>`_, as this document will primarily discuss the concepts of the API and how to use them at a high level.
